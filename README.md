## 💡 Why AquaGuard?
Water-distribution networks are critical infrastructure, yet real-world sensor deployments can be costly and difficult to access for prototyping analytics dashboards.  
**AquaGuard** fills the gap by providing:

* **Realistic data simulation** of temperature, pressure and flow-rate sensors.  
* **A modern web dashboard** to visualise, analyse and download readings.  
* **An integrated AI chatbot** (Gemini API) trained to answer questions on water management.

All in an open-source, plug-and-play repository you can spin up locally in minutes.

## ✨ Key Features
| Category | Details |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Data simulation** | Python scripts generate timestamped readings (°C, bar, L/min) at user-defined intervals and save them to **`Data/Readings.csv`**. |
| **Dashboard** | `/` shows the latest values, a trend preview. |
| **AI Chatbot** | Built with Google Gemini—ask anything from “How to detect leaks?” to “Optimal pipe diameters”. |
| **Deep visualisation** | `/visualize` renders interactive line graphs, highlights anomalies (e.g. sudden pressure drops), and key stats (min/max). It also lets you filter by custom date-time range. |
| **Real-Time** | The datas are fetched every minute and the graphs and dashboard are updated to view the trends in real time. |
| **CSV export** | One-click download of all collected data. |
